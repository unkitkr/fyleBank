            <p>The app is built for the take-home assignment by <a href="https://www.fylehq.com/">fyle</a>. The data in the app may be old hence please do not use it for actual reference.</p>
                  <p>Important learnings:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>üî¢ Pagination: Extremely large pagination values are generated when the page size is reduced significantly (an inversely proportional relationship. Therefore, to mitigate that I came up with an intuitive jump-to numerical input box that does the job and gives a fluid experience. Of course, to make it more intuitive, I added a previous and next button.</li>
                      <li>üíæ Database migrations: Until now although I&apos;ve been building applications with three-tier architecture, most of the time the database was on the same server hence didn&apos;t require any extra parameters for the host resolution also, I built an ETL route to move the data from the CSV to the database. (Commented out the route but it is still there in the backend).</li>
                      <li>üç• Design: Although there was a fun requirement to build a separate view for the bank details, I felt that would be overkill since the information to be displayed was limited. Hence I used the card-like structure to make it look not only better but also reduced an extra effort to get the bank information.</li>
                      <li>üîñ Storing and marking favourite banks: Used the localstorage API for the first time which I think solved a lot of problem for in document storage.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>I hope you liked the application.</p>

              <ol>
                  <li>Flask (Backend business logic): Although I was familiar with Django, however in the interest of time, I choose to do the assignment in flask since I&apos;ve used this multiple times.</li>
                  <li>React (Frontend): React and Vue were the only frontend frameworks known to me. Also since I&apos;ve completed a couple of projects using react during my internship, I preferred React. However I explored Angular too but due to the time constraint, I went with what I already knew.</li>
                  <li>Database: PostgreSQL (I&apos;ve used Postgres as my primary database most of the time.</li>
                  <li>Design: For the design principles I used Material design specifications by google (which I use every time by default).</li>
